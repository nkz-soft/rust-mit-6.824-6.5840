### [6.5840 Lab 1: MapReduce](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-mr.html)

MapReduce is a framework for distributed data processing. It is a general framework for distributed data processing, 
which can be used to process data in parallel on a cluster of machines.

### 1. Preliminary preparation

1. Papers to read: [rfeet.qrk (mit.edu)](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/papers/mapreduce.pdf)
2. LAB is officially implemented based on go, but you need to understand the details of some code comments,
   the overall framework and the test situation, so you still need to download and read it carefully.
    ```bash
    git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.5840-golabs-2024
    ```
